Acts as Group provides a means for communication on multi-user blogs.

== Description ==

The Acts as Group plugin provides a means for communication on multi-user blogs. You can create user groups for any purpose. It also allows you to communicate with other users through a Twitter-like interface on the WordPress Administration Panel.

= Who should use the Acts as Group plugin? =

Acts as Group is designed to help people who participate in multi-user blogging or group blogging. If you are seeking a simple way to communicate among members and don't want an overly complicated solution, Acts as Group is your best choice.

= Is this a Twitter client? Does it require a Twitter account to use? =

No. Acts as Group is not a Twitter client and you don't need a Twitter account to use it. Only a user account on the WordPress blog is needed.

= Who can see the group messages? =

Only group members can see the group messages. Its interface is closed so that your privacy is securely protected.

= We use P2. Should we switch to Acts as Group? =

You don't have to switch, but if you desire a more closed way of communication, Acts as Group would be a good option to try.

Yes, of course.
